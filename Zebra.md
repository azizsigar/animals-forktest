**Note:** Zebras are among the most recognizable mammals in the animal kingdom, famed for their distinctive black and white striped coats. These stripes are unique to each individual, much like human fingerprints, and serve various purposes, including camouflage, temperature regulation, and deterring pests like flies. Zebras belong to the Equidae family, which includes horses and donkeys, but zebras are known for their social behavior, forming large herds for protection against predators like lions and hyenas. Primarily found in the grasslands and savannas of Africa, their diet consists mainly of grass, which they spend the majority of their day grazing on. Despite their peaceful grazing habits, zebras are capable of powerful defense mechanisms, including strong kicks and strategic group formations. Their striking appearance and fascinating social structures have made them a subject of study and admiration worldwide.
