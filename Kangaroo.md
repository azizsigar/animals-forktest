**Note:** 
Kangaroos are iconic marsupials native to Australia, symbolizing the unique wildlife of the continent. These fascinating creatures are known for their powerful hind legs, which enable them to leap great distances and speeds, making them unparalleled jumpers among mammals. Kangaroos are also distinguished by their method of reproduction; their young, known as joeys, are born at a very early stage of development and continue to grow in the safety of their mother's pouch. They are primarily herbivores, grazing on grasses and leaves, and can be found in a variety of habitats across Australia, from wooded forests to grassy plains. Kangaroos live in social groups called mobs, which provide protection against predators. With their adaptive abilities, kangaroos have thrived in Australia's diverse ecosystems, playing a significant role in the cultural and natural heritage of their homeland.
